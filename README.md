FacebookPopSideViewAnimations
=============================

This is an example to demonstrate how you can set frames of UIViews using Facebook Pop animation engine to mimic the functionality of bringing UIViewControllers from both sides (Left and Right). Also, you can present a UIView from bottom to top, similar to presenting a UIViewController natively.
